Dear JSConf & CSSConf Budapest Speakers!

**TL;DR:**  
Mozilla would like to invite you to host a hands-on "hacksession" or workshop in the Mozilla Hackerlounge during one of the conference days!


Contrary to previous years we decided to try something new, and besides promoting Mozilla and open web technologies we want to give a stage for the speakers (and conference audience) to teach something new/cool/handy/awesome to the attendees: thus the Mozilla Hackerlounge was born.

Usually conference talks are densely packed with information, and after an invigorating presemtation, there is often a need to dive in - Mozilla firmly believes in "learning-by-doing" so we'd like to ask you to give a "hacksession" in the topic of your choosing (but probably somehow connected to the talk you were to be presenting) in the hackerlounge. Hackerlounge sessions will be short (1 hour tops) sessions in which attendees get a chance to try out some of the things they'll have heard at the conference -- with the help and guidance of the "pros". The sessions run parallel to the talks, so expect people coming and going, sticking around for some hacking and moving along.

For more info about the format, please check [this readme](1).


**APPLY HERE:**  
> If you are interested in hosting a session, please drop an email with your topic at flaki@mozilla.hu or just [file an issue on the repo](2) - also feel free to send any questions my way on twitter/email, should you have any!

Please do this **by the end of April**, as any remaining slots will be offered to the attendees to propose a session for!


Thank you in advance and looking forward to welcoming you all in the Hackerlounge!

Cheers,
István Szmozsánszky "Flaki"
