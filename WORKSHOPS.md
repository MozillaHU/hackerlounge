# Workshops

The Mozilla hackerlounge will host several short workshops (more like quick, mentored hack-hours) every day introducing not just Mozilla technologies, but technologies all around the Open Web Platform. During the three conference days everyone can find a topic that appeals to them and after hearing a short introduction can stick around for a bit of hacking, with mentor(s) helping/guiding them.

## Workshop format

The conference is a single-track conference, with blocks of 30-minute talks & short breaks in-between. This leaves self-contained ~1-hour "blocks" in which workshops will be happenning at the Hackerlounge, in parallel with the talks at the main stage.

Every workshop starts ~10 minutes before the end of the break with a quick _"lightning talk"_ intro on the subject of the upcoming session. Mentors of the sessions can be mozillians, speakers or attendees of the conference - basically anyone can do a workshop, as long as:
* the topic is in line with [Mozilla Values](https://www.mozilla.org/mission/)
* the mentor has valid means of getting into the conference on the day of their session (speaker, ticket, invite etc.)
* the mentor has pre-arranged a timeslot with the Hackerlounge organizers, and appears on the [Schedule](#Schedule)

Every type and kind of workshop/session is welcome, not just technical talks, we especially encourage mentors to apply for community, mental health, diversity and open-source related sessions!

By the end of the break, people attending the lightning talk part of the session can decide whether they go for talks, or stick around for the workshop part of the session. For the workshop session (which lasts until the start of the next break), mentors could have a more interactive session/brainstorming, hand out hardware or other means of tools for attendees to hack on, or simply provide a bunch of links & resources for attendees to get started hacking on the topic, and provide individual guidance & mentorship during the hacking session.

### Submitting a workshop
