If you haven't received the e-mail containing the link, DM [@jsconfbp](https://twitter.com/jsconfbp) on Twitter or send an e-mail to _flaki at mozilla dot hu_, including the e-mail address you registered to the conference from.

### Lightning talks format
All lightning talks are a maximum of 7 minutes, no Q&A, no live coding, no own computer use is allowed. With their submission one can include a link to any URL pointing to an image, webpage, PDF file or online slide deck which will be opened in a web browser before their presentation and they will be provided a clicker to advance slides (if applicable).  
Some lightning talks may be recorded and made available online after the event, unless requested otherwise by the presenter.

### Lightning talk schedule
_TBD_

## Community Talks
Every day at JSConf Budapest we have a fun & engaging community talk scheduled at the Zalando lounge (upstairs) in the first half of the lunch break, presented by Mozilla & Zalando.  
Just grab some food and settle in for some CSS and HTML5 games wizardry!

### Day 1 - Eva Lettner - The Magic of CSS
`Thurdsay 12:45`

![Talk: Eva Lettner](talks-eva.jpg)
> Creating art is as old as humankind. Over time the techniques have changed. This talk will introduce CSS as a medium to create images and animations made up of pure code. You will learn to view code differently, to create more concise markups in the future, and you will learn the basics of drawing with CSS to set you on your way of creating CSS Art.

### Day 2 - Lisa Passing - Making web API games
`Friday 12:45`

![Talk: Lisa Passing](talks-lislis.jpg)
> The web offers a variety of really interesting APIs. But usually they never seem to quite fit the purpose of your current project. How will you ever get to try them out?  
> My solution: Make a game!  
> Let me show you how I make small scoped, browser based games using web APIs as part of interaction or game play.


## Community Discussions in the Hackerlounge
On both days in the second half of the lunch break the Mozilla Hackerlounge transforms into a discussion area. Flaki will be chatting with fellow conference organizers, speakers, teachers and mentors about public speaking, conference organizing, mentoring, diversity and other hot topics in the tech community.

### Day 1 - Public Speaking and Conferences
`Thursday 13:30`

Conferences (especially the way they are organized) are still a mystery to a lot of people, and public speaking is still largely considered this terrifying mess that I am not very good at so I'll just let others do it, instead. But it shouldn't be like this at all! This discussion is to debunk the myths and hearsay surrounding conferences and public speaking and to encourage more people to dare embark on this journey, either submitting and speaking at an event or organizing one themselves.

**Moderator:** Flaki  
**Discussion partners:** Felicitas Kugland (JSConf EU), Madeleine Neumann (RuhrJS), Kevin Lorenz (CSSConf EU) & more!

### Day 2 - Teaching and Learning the Web
`Thursday 13:30`

Mozilla has always been a vocal advocate of "web- and digital literacy", but especially in today's web that is changing in  an almost untrackable pace teaching and learning comes in all kinds of shapes and sizes. Is it for polishing one's own skills after having been a web developer for long? Or just barely starting up after deciding to switch careers? Even, someone trying to encourage this as a teacher/mentor to provide access to more diverse folks to make up the tech scene as we know it today, the questions, needs and methods arising when acquiring news skills vary wildly and are something worth talking about. The goal is to encourage and inspire the conference attendees to grow their skills and help others, as these people will be the ones who will make up the next frontline in this battle for a better tech community.

**Moderator:** Flaki  
**Discussion partners:** Pilar Huidobro _(RailsGirls Summer of Code)_, Tibor Szasz _(Greenfox Academy)_, Nemeth Adam _(METU Jump!)_, Lisa Passing _(ClojureBridge Berlin, RGSoC)_ & more!


## Hackerlounge demos

### Experience [WebVR](https://mozvr.com/)
![Demo: Mozilla WebVR](demos-webvr.jpg)  

Visit the Mozilla Hackerlounge to learn more about WebVR and experience it yourself! WebVR is a new web standard for exposing the hardware and software primitives of virtual reality to web pages, and making these technologies availabe for web developers to provide low-friction access VR content to anyone with a web browser.  
Despite being a rather new standard, various mobile browses and [Firefox on the desktop](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/06/01/mozilla-brings-virtual-reality-to-all-firefox-users/) already support WebVR â€” even in the stable (consumer) versions of the browsers.

### Meet Servo, [play with WebBluetooth](https://twitter.com/RustHungary/status/911654669813993472)

![Demo: Servo WebBluetooth](demos-webbluetooth.jpg)

Join the team from University of Szeged to learn more about [Servo](https://servo.org/), the experimental browser engine developed at Mozilla (and powering the upcoming [Firefox Quantum](https://thenextweb.com/tech/2017/09/26/mozillas-firefox-quantum-browser-is-ridiculously-fast/)). The USzeged team will also showcase the WebBluetooth implementation they developed and you will get a chance to experience it yourself - play with quadrocopters and RC cars using nothing more but a browser, thanks to the WebBluetooth API.


## Speaker Q&A Sessions
Come to the Mozilla Hackerlounge in the breaks not just to try cool demos and listen to community talks, but also to meet and ask questions and chat with the speakers at the conference! Keep your ears peeled as speakers will announce after their talks at what time they will be hanging around the Hackerlounge so you can drop by and ask your questions!
