Just grab some food and settle in for some CSS and HTML5 games wizardry!

**Note: change in talk schedules!**

### Day 1 - Lisa Passing - Making web API games
⏰ `Thursday 12:45`

![Talk: Lisa Passing](talks-lislis.jpg)
> The web offers a variety of really interesting APIs. But usually they never seem to quite fit the purpose of your current project. How will you ever get to try them out?  
> My solution: Make a game!  
> Let me show you how I make small scoped, browser based games using web APIs as part of interaction or game play.

### Day 2 - Manel Rhaiem - Virtual Reality on the Web with A-frame
⏰ `Friday 12:45`

![Talk: Lisa Passing](talks-manel.jpg)
> WebVR gives first-hand access to Virtual Reality for web developers and all of the web's citizens, making browsers a first-class citizen in the VR ecosystem. But creating 3D content was never easy in the browser, and this didn't get any better for whole scenes. This is where Mozilla's open-source A-frame li
brary comes to play, letting you create Virtual Reality content easily and effortlessly with a familiar syntax!


## Community Discussions in the Hackerlounge
On both days in the second half of the lunch break the Mozilla Hackerlounge transforms into a discussion area. Flaki will be chatting with fellow conference organizers, speakers, teachers and mentors about public speaking, conference organizing, mentoring, diversity and other hot topics in the tech community.

**Have a question that you want answered by our panel of speakers? Tweet it with the `#mozhacks` hashtag and get an answer live in the Hackerlounge!**

### Day 1 - Public Speaking and Conferences
⏰ `Thursday 13:30`  
**Moderator:** Flaki  
**Discussion partners:** Felicitas Kugland (JSConf EU), Madeleine Neumann (RuhrJS), Kevin Lorenz (CSSConf EU) & more!

> Conferences (especially the way they are organized) are still a mystery to a lot of people, and public speaking is still largely considered this terrifying mess that I am not very good at so I'll just let others do it, instead. But it shouldn't be like this at all! This discussion is to debunk the myths and hearsay surrounding conferences and public speaking and to encourage more people to dare embark on this journey, either submitting and speaking at an event or organizing one themselves.


### Day 2 - Teaching and Learning the Web
⏰ `Thursday 13:30`  
**Moderator:** Flaki  
**Discussion partners:** Pilar Huidobro _(RailsGirls Summer of Code)_, Tibor Szasz _(Greenfox Academy)_, Nemeth Adam _(METU Jump!)_, Lisa Passing _(ClojureBridge Berlin, RGSoC)_ & more!

> Mozilla has always been a vocal advocate of "web- and digital literacy", but especially in today's web that is changing in  an almost untrackable pace teaching and learning comes in all kinds of shapes and sizes. Is it for polishing one's own skills after having been a web developer for long? Or just barely starting up after deciding to switch careers? Even, someone trying to encourage this as a teacher/mentor to provide access to more diverse folks to make up the tech scene as we know it today, the questions, needs and methods arising when acquiring news skills vary wildly and are something worth talking about. The goal is to encourage and inspire the conference attendees to grow their skills and help others, as these people will be the ones who will make up the next frontline in this battle for a better tech community.


## Hackerlounge demos

### Experience [WebVR](https://mozvr.com/)
![Demo: Mozilla WebVR](demos-webvr.jpg)  

Visit the Mozilla Hackerlounge to learn more about WebVR and experience it yourself! WebVR is a new web standard for exposing the hardware and software primitives of virtual reality to web pages, and making these technologies availabe for web developers to provide low-friction access VR content to anyone with a web browser.  
Despite being a rather new standard, various mobile browses and [Firefox on the desktop](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/06/01/mozilla-brings-virtual-reality-to-all-firefox-users/) already support WebVR — even in the stable (consumer) versions of the browsers.

![Demo: in-game.hu](https://scontent-frx5-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-19/s150x150/15877567_562565297275926_5377523174575439872_n.jpg)

We would like to thank [in-game.hu](http://in-game.hu) for providing us with a complete VR setup and an HTC Vive, making it possible for us to show people the true immersive power of WebVR experiences!


### Meet Servo, [play with WebBluetooth](https://twitter.com/RustHungary/status/911654669813993472)

![Demo: Servo WebBluetooth](demos-webbluetooth.jpg)

Join the team from University of Szeged to learn more about [Servo](https://servo.org/), the experimental browser engine developed at Mozilla (and powering the upcoming [Firefox Quantum](https://thenextweb.com/tech/2017/09/26/mozillas-firefox-quantum-browser-is-ridiculously-fast/)). The USzeged team will also showcase the WebBluetooth implementation they developed and you will get a chance to experience it yourself - play with quadrocopters and RC cars using nothing more but a browser, thanks to the WebBluetooth API.


## Speaker Q&A Sessions
Come to the Mozilla Hackerlounge in the breaks not just to try cool demos and listen to community talks, but also to meet and ask questions and chat with the speakers at the conference! Keep your ears peeled as speakers will announce after their talks at what time they will be hanging around the Hackerlounge so you can drop by and ask your questions!
